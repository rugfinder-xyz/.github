# RBrank: Revolutionizing Blockchain Risk Assessment

## Our Vision

RBrank is building the first decentralized blockchain risk assessment platform that empowers users to identify and evaluate potential risks in blockchain projects and accounts. We're creating a community-driven ecosystem where information is not just shared but validated, incentivized, and accessible to everyone.

## The Problem We're Solving

In the rapidly evolving blockchain space:
- **Scams and fraudulent projects** continue to proliferate
- **Risk information is fragmented** across social media and forums
- **No standardized assessment framework** exists for evaluating projects
- **Individual users lack tools** to make informed decisions
- **Valuable risk information** goes unrewarded and unverified
